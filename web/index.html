        Hi!!!  JR here, main programmer for farragnarok and really most of farrago ficitions shit.

        How are you doing???  I'm REALLY excited you're poking around in the source code, makes me all nostalgic.

        Before PL showed up to do the Voidy Thing, I coded entirely in javascript and it was BULLSHIT. BUT!
        It was bullshit that let me do things where y'all could see me. I used to leave all SORTS of riddles
        and hints and stupid jokes in my code just for that.

        But dart auto-minifies the resultant javascript and strips out comments and what is even the POINT???

        smdh

        ANYWAYS the reason I'm here and you're here is you want secrets or sweet coding tips and I am 113% behind that.
        SO, you can follow along at home over here:

        Have fun ;) ;) ;)

    <div class = 'paragraph'>
        <br>Farragnarok is the tale of 8 chosen Heroes, each with a Land custom tailored to their personalities and fate, colliding into a cascade of plot, intrigue and coincidences.

        <br><br>As each Hero, you explore their Land, learn its secrets and listen to the stories of their mysterious animal inhabitants. Each land has a Titan plaguing it in some fashion, and it is up to the chosen Hero to save the day, while just maybe learning something about themselves.... Is what I WOULD say if everything didn't go off the rails even before the first second.  Hidden depths lurk in each Land as meta narrative and gameplay intertwine in a mysterious fashion. I wonder why each of these Heroes seems utterly unsurprised by the mysterious cirumstances they find themselves in???

        <br><Br>For more details, choose specific Lands to learn about in the navbar above.

        <div class = 'header'>Key Features</div>
        <Br><Br> <b>8 planned lands with Unique Gameplay</b>: Each Land in Farragnarok is tailor made for its Hero, with different aesthetics, gameplay and themes.
        <Br><Br>As an example, the Land of Horticulture and Essence is themed around the creation and destruction of Life, as wells as Life's inevitable destructive progression from Childhood's acceptance to early Adulthood's rejection.  Will you be able to grow past the control of the parental figure Titan?
        <Br><Br> <b>Character Interaction</b>: Each Land contains links to PALDEMIC chat client conversations between Heroes. It is also planned for Heroes to begin finding ways to leave their own Lands and visit each other, stirring up even more chaos as they do so.
        <Br><Br> <b>Procedural Elements</b>: Each Land contains some key element of procedural generation, whether its the tree designs for The Land of Horticulture and Essence, the map for The Land of Mists and Trails, or even the narrative itself in [DATA EXPUNGED].
