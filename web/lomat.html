        Hi!!!  JR here, main programmer for farragnarok and really most of farrago ficitions shit.

        How are you doing???  I'm REALLY excited you're poking around in the source code, makes me all nostalgic.

        Before PL showed up to do the Voidy Thing, I coded entirely in javascript and it was BULLSHIT. BUT!
        It was bullshit that let me do things where y'all could see me. I used to leave all SORTS of riddles
        and hints and stupid jokes in my code just for that.

        But dart auto-minifies the resultant javascript and strips out comments and what is even the POINT???

        smdh

        ANYWAYS the reason I'm here and you're here is you want secrets or sweet coding tips and I am 113% behind that.
        SO, you can follow along at home over here:

        Have fun ;) ;) ;)
